<h1>Pavan Kumar Reddy snips a play</h1>
<p>MRS. X. _enters, dressed in hat and winter coat, and carrying a
    pretty Japanese basket on her arm_.</p>
<p>MISS Y. _has in front of her a partly emptied bottle of beer; she
    is reading an illustrated weekly, and every now and then, she
    exchanges it for a new one_.</p>
<p>MRS. X. Well, how do, Millie! Here you are sitting on Christmas Eve, as
    lonely as a poor bachelor.</p>
<p> [MISS Y. _looks up from the paper for a moment, nods, and resumes
    her reading_.]
</p>
<p>MRS. X. Really, I feel sorry to find you like this--alone--alone in a
    restaurant, and on Christmas Eve of all times. It makes me as sad as
    when I saw a wedding party at Paris once in a restaurant--the bride was
    reading a comic paper and the groom was playing billiards with the
    witnesses. Ugh, when it begins that way, I thought, how will it end?
    Think of it, playing billiards on his wedding day! Yes, and you're going
    to say that she was reading a comic paper--- that's a different case, my
    dear.

<p>[_A waitress brings a cup of chocolate, places it before_ MRS. X.,
    _and disappears again_.</p>
<p>MRS. X. [_Sips a few spoonfuls; opens the basket and displays a number
    of Christmas presents._] See what I've bought for my tots. [_Picks up a
    doll._] What do you think of this? Lisa is to have it. She can roll her
    eyes and twist her head, do you see? Fine, is it not? And here's a cork
    pistol for Carl.</p>
